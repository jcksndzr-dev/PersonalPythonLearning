🧠 Project Idea: "Daily Mood Journal CLI App"
🎯 Objective
Build a command-line application that lets users log their mood each day, along with a short note. The app should store entries, allow users to view past logs, and maybe even show mood trends over time.

🛠️ Features to Implement
Add a new journal entry: Prompt for date, mood (e.g., happy, sad, stressed), and a short note.

View entries: Show all past entries or filter by mood.

Save entries: Store data in a file so it persists between sessions.

Analyze trends (optional): Count how many times each mood appears.
